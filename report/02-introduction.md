# Introduction to Sequences

A **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers that follow a specific pattern.

## Arithmetic Progression (A.P.)

In an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by **adding** a constant value called the **common difference** ($d$) to the previous term.

$$a_n = a + (n-1)d$$

Where:
- $a$ = first term
- $d$ = common difference
- $n$ = term number

## Geometric Progression (G.P.)

In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by **multiplying** the previous term by a constant value called the **common ratio** ($r$).

$$a_n = ar^{n-1}$$

Where:
- $a$ = first term
- $r$ = common ratio
- $n$ = term number
