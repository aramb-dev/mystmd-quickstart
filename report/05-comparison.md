# Comparison of A.P. & G.P.

| Feature | Arithmetic Progression | Geometric Progression |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Pattern** | Add constant $d$ | Multiply by constant $r$ |
| **Formula** | $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ | $a_n = ar^{n-1}$ |
| **Graph** | Straight line | Curved (exponential) |
| **Growth** | Linear | Exponential |
| **My Example** | Weekly savings (+\$10) | Car depreciation (×0.8) |

## Key Differences

**Arithmetic:** The difference between consecutive terms is constant.
$$a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2 = d$$

**Geometric:** The ratio between consecutive terms is constant.
$$\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{a_3}{a_2} = r$$
