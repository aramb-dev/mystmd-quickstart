# Conclusion

Through this project, I explored two types of sequences using real-life examples:

1. **Arithmetic Progression** - My savings plan where I add \$10 weekly. The graph shows a straight line because the growth is constant.

2. **Geometric Progression** - My car's depreciation where the value drops by 20% yearly. The graph shows a curve because the change is proportional.

Both sequences have practical applications. A.P. helps predict savings over time, while G.P. models things like depreciation, population growth, and compound interest.
